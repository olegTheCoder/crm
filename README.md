## Furniture store CRM

This is a prototype of a CRM for a big furniture store in Moscow. Our client allowed us to provide this prototype in public, so here we are!

It was deployed on Heroku: https://crmfurniture.herokuapp.com/users

Stack, we used: JS, Express, Bootstrap, PSQL, Sequelize.

Here's gif-demo, how it works:
